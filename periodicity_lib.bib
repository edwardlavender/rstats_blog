abstract = {Abstract The programming language R is widely used in many fields. We explored the extent of reported R use in the field of ecology using the Web of Science and text mining. We analyzed the frequencies of R packages reported in more than 60,000 peer-reviewed articles published in 30 ecology journals during a 10-yr period ending in 2017. The number of studies reported using R as their primary tool in data analysis increased linearly from 11.4{\%} in 2008 to 58.0{\%} in 2017. The top 10 packages reported were lme4, vegan, nlme, ape, MuMIn, MASS, mgcv, ade4, multcomp, and car. The increasing popularity of R has most likely furthered open science in ecological research because it can improve reproducibility of analyses and captures workflows when scripts and codes are included and shared. These findings may not be entirely unique to R because there are other programming languages used by ecologists, but they do strongly suggest that given the relatively high frequency of reported use of R, it is a significant component of contemporary analytics in the field of ecology.},

abstract = {Animal telemetry is a powerful tool for observing marine animals and the physical environments that they inhabit, from coastal and continental shelf ecosystems to polar seas and open oceans. Satellite-linked biologgers and networks of acoustic receivers allow animals to be reliably monitored over scales of tens of meters to thousands of kilometers, giving insight into their habitat use, home range size, the phenology of migratory patterns and the biotic and abiotic factors that drive their distributions. Furthermore, physical environmental variables can be collected using animals as autonomous sampling platforms, increasing spatial and temporal coverage of global oceanographic observation systems. The use of animal telemetry, therefore, has the capacity to provide measures from a suite of essential ocean variables (EOVs) for improved monitoring of Earth's oceans. Here we outline the design features of animal telemetry systems, describe current applications and their benefits and challenges, and discuss future directions. We describe new analytical techniques that improve our ability to not only quantify animal movements but to also provide a powerful framework for comparative studies across taxa. We discuss the application of animal telemetry and its capacity to collect biotic and abiotic data, how the data collected can be incorporated into ocean observing systems, and the role these data can play in improved ocean management.},

abstract = {Researchers have long attempted to follow animals as they move through their environment. Until relatively recently, however, such efforts were limited to short distances and times in species large enough to carry large batteries and transmitters. New technologies have opened up new frontiers in animal tracking remote data collection. Hussey et al. review the unique directions such efforts have taken for marine systems, while Kays et al. review recent advances for terrestrial species. We have entered a new era of animal ecology, where animals act as both subjects and samplers of their environments.Science, this issue 10.1126/science.1255642, 10.1126/science.aaa2478BACKGROUNDThe movement of animals makes them fascinating but difficult study subjects. Animal movements underpin many biological phenomena, and understanding them is critical for applications in conservation, health, and food. Traditional approaches to animal tracking used field biologists wielding antennas to record a few dozen locations per animal, revealing only the most general patterns of animal space use. The advent of satellite tracking automated this process, but initially was limited to larger animals and increased the resolution of trajectories to only a few hundred locations per animal. The last few years have shown exponential improvement in tracking technology, leading to smaller tracking devices that can return millions of movement steps for ever-smaller animals. Finally, we have a tool that returns high-resolution data that reveal the detailed facets of animal movement and its many implications for biodiversity, animal ecology, behavior, and ecosystem function.ADVANCESImproved technology has brought animal tracking into the realm of big data, not only through high-resolution movement trajectories, but also through the addition of other on-animal sensors and the integration of remote sensing data about the environment through which these animals are moving. These new data are opening up a breadth of new scientific questions about ecology, evolution, and physiology and enable the use of animals as sensors of the environment. High–temporal resolution movement data also can document brief but important contacts between animals, creating new opportunities to study social networks, as well as interspecific interactions such as competition and predation. With solar panels keeping batteries charged, “lifetime” tracks can now be collected for some species, while broader approaches are aiming for species-wide sampling across multiple populations. Miniaturized tags also help reduce the impact of the devices on the study subjects, improving animal welfare and scientific results. As in other disciplines, the explosion of data volume and variety has created new challenges and opportunities for information management, integration, and analysis. In an exciting interdisciplinary push, biologists, statisticians, and computer scientists have begun to develop new tools that are already leading to new insights and scientific breakthroughs.OUTLOOKWe suggest that a golden age of animal tracking science has begun and that the upcoming years will be a time of unprecedented exciting discoveries. Technology continues to improve our ability to track animals, with the promise of smaller tags collecting more data, less invasively, on a greater variety of animals. The big-data tracking studies that are just now being pioneered will become commonplace. If analytical developments can keep pace, the field will be able to develop real-time predictive models that integrate habitat preferences, movement abilities, sensory capacities, and animal memories into movement forecasts. The unique perspective offered by big-data animal tracking enables a new view of animals as naturally evolved sensors of environment, which we think has the potential to help us monitor the planet in completely new ways. A massive multi-individual monitoring program would allow a quorum sensing of our planet, using a variety of species to tap into the diversity of senses that have evolved across animal groups, providing new insight on our world through the sixth sense of the global animal collective. We expect that the field will soon reach a transformational point where these studies do more than inform us about particular species of animals, but allow the animals to teach us about the world.Big-data animal tracking.The red trajectory shows how studies can now track animals with unprecedented detail, allowing researchers to predict the causes and consequences of movements, and animals to become environmental sensors. Multisensor tracking tags monitor movement, behavior, physiology, and environmental context. Geo- and biosciences merge now using a multitude of remote-sensing data. Understanding how social and interspecific interactions affect movement is the next big frontier.Moving animals connect our world, spreading pollen, seeds, nutrients, and parasites as they go about the their daily lives. Recent integration of high-resolution Global Positioning System and other sensors into miniaturized tracking tags has dramatically improved our ability to describe animal movement. This has created opportunities and challenges that parallel big data transformations in other fields and has rapidly advanced animal ecology and physiology. New analytical approaches, combined with remotely sensed or modeled environmental information, have opened up a host of new questions on the causes of movement and its consequences for individuals, populations, and ecosystems. Simultaneous tracking of multiple animals is leading to new insights on species interactions and, scaled up, may enable distributed monitoring of both animals and our changing environment.},

abstract = {Many shallow-water organisms are subjected to regular, frequent and considerable changes in their environment imposed by the tides. Such changes range from complex alterations in local conditions, as in the intertidal zone, to simpler variations in current speed and direction offshore. To take advantage of the opportunities these changes provide, many animals undertake regular vertical and/or horizontal migratory movements in synchrony with the tidal cycle. Others use tidal currents selectively for transport to new habitats. Such movements vary in extent from a few mm to several km and may be modulated by the diel cycle of light intensity. This paper reviews the existence of tidal migration in marine animals from various taxa and habitats. Crustacean and sh examples illustrate the various functions of tidal migration, including transport, feeding, predator avoidance and reproduction. These functions are not necessarily mutually exclusive and may change throughout ontogeny. The mechanisms involved in migration are discussed in terms of direct reactions to environmental stimuli and the interaction of these responses with endogenous rhythms of activity and responsiveness.},

The versatility and attractiveness of the wavelet approach lie in its decomposition properties, principally its time-scale localization. It is especially relevant to the analysis of non-stationary systems, i.e., systems with short-lived transient components, like those observed in ecological systems. Here, we review the basic properties of the wavelet approach for time-series analysis from an ecological perspective. Wavelet decomposition offers several advantages that are discussed in this paper and illustrated by appropriate synthetic and ecological examples. Wavelet analysis is notably free from the assumption of stationarity that makes most methods unsuitable for many ecological time series. Wavelet analysis also permits analysis of the relationships between two signals, and it is especially appropriate for following gradual change in forcing by exogenous variables.},

New statistical significance tests for wavelet power spectra are developed by deriving theoretical wavelet spectra for white and red noise processes and using these to establish significance levels and confidence intervals. It is shown that smoothing in time or scale can be used to increase the confidence of the wavelet spectrum.

@article{Gabor_1946,
abstract = {Hitherto communication theory was based on two alternative methods of signal analysis. One is the description of the signal as a function of time; the other is Fourier analysis. Both are idealizations, as the first method operates with sharply defined instants of time, the second with infinite wave-trains of rigorously defined frequencies. But our everyday experiences—especially our auditory sensations—insist on a description in terms of both time and frequency. In the present paper this point of view is developed in quantitative language. Signals are represented in two dimensions, with time and frequency as co-ordinates. Such two-dimensional representations can be called “information diagrams,” as areas in them are proportional to the number of independent data which they can convey. This is a consequence of the fact that the frequency of a signal which is not of infinite duration can be defined only with a certain inaccuracy, which is inversely proportional to the duration, and vice versa. This “uncertainty relation” suggests a new method of description, intermediate between the two extremes of time analysis and spectral analysis. There are certain “elementary signals” which occupy the smallest possible area in the information diagram. They are harmonic oscillations modulated by a “probability pulse.” Each elementary signal can be considered as conveying exactly one datum, or one “quantum of information.” Any signal can be expanded in terms of these by a process which includes time analysis and Fourier analysis as extreme cases.These new methods of analysis, which involve some of the mathematical apparatus of quantum theory, are illustrated by application to some problems of transmission theory, such as direct generation of single sidebands, signals transmitted in minimum time through limited frequency channels, frequency modulation and time-division multiplex telephony.},

abstract = {The living clock that governs tide-associated organismic rhythms has previously been assumed to have a fundamental period of approximately 12.4 h, an interval that reflects the average period of the ebb and flow of the tide. But, in 1986, marine chronobiologists began to accumulate laboratory results that could not be explained by the action of such a clock. Prime among these findings was the discovery that, occasionally, one of the two daily peaks in an organism's rhythm assumed a different period from its partner. Similar results have since been observed in a host of different organisms. These data led to the circalunidian-clock hypothesis that envisions two basic 24.8 h clocks, coupled together in antiphase, as the driving force for these rhythms. There is, however, only a slight difference (50 minutes) in running times between a solar-day clock with a period of approximately 24 h and a lunar-day clock with a period of approximately 24.8 h, both of which display “circa” periods that overlap.

abstract = {Environmental change is transforming ecological assemblages into new configurations, resulting in novel communities. We developed a robust methodology to detect novel communities, examine patterns of emergence, and quantify probabilities of local demographic turnover in transitions to and from novel communities. Using a global dataset of Cenozoic marine plankton communities, we found that the probability of local extinction, origination, and emigration during transitions to a novel community increased two to four times that of background community changes. Although rare, novel communities were five times more likely than chance to shift into another novel state. For marine plankton communities at a 100,000-year time grain, novel communities were sensitive to further extinctions and substantial community change. P rofound changes in the biodiversity of global ecosystems (1, 2) are leading to the formation of novel communities, where species composition and diversity are transformed into new, nonhis-torical configurations with altered ecosystem functions (3-6). Key factors driving novel community emergence include the rapid pace of global climate change (7-9), breakdown of biogeographic barriers, species invasions, and ecosystem degradation (10-12). Here, we introduce a reproducible, objective, and quantitative approach to detect novel communities from time series compositional data, apply this approach to investigate the frequency of emergence and transition probabilities of community novelty over long temporal scales, and explore the demographic processes that influence the rise and fall of novel community states. The conceptual basis of novel ecosystems spans multiple disciplines. For conservation biologists, novel ecosystems contain historically unprecedented combinations of species that are driven by human agency, often with altered ecological functions (3). The no-analog community concept from plant paleoecology focuses on the taxonomic composition or environmental framework of past communities that are com-positionally unlike any found today (13). A variety of quantitative analytical approaches have been used to understand how and why past (13-16) or even future (4) vegetation dynamics in focal ecosystems differ from the present. Early emphasis on the role of novel climates in ecological change (13, 17) has prompted more recent robust quantitative investigation of the geographic variation and temporal distribution of novel climates (8, 16), including under various Representative Concentration Pathway scenarios (18, 19). We build on these previous approaches to provide a new novelty-detection framework (20) that accords with modern definitions of novel ecosystems (3) and enables comparative ecosystem approaches to understand general trends, causes, and consequences of novelty on a global scale. Our framework defines novel communities as having two signals of compositional change: (i) rapid change to (ii) an unprecedented state. We quantified these by decomposing an ecological time series within a site into two sets of dissimilarity scores (using the Jaccard index): a metric of community change through time (rate of change, called "instantaneous dissimilarity") (Fig. 1, A and D) and the smallest dissim-ilarity to any past composition (community novelness, called "cumulative dissimilarity") (Fig. 1, A and C). We classified communities as novel only where these observed dissim-ilarities exceeded expectations, generated for each time series using parametric spline-based models (20). These models estimated average dissimilarities (Fig. 1B, dashed lines) that could increase or decrease along the time series, meaning that novelty was assessed relative to local windows of time. Novelty occurred where observed dissimilarities exceeded 95{\%} predictive intervals of expectations (Fig. 1B, gray shading). This resulted in four possible community states: faster-than-expected community turnover ("instantaneous novelty," I), a community state more distinct than expected from any prior state ("cumulative novelty," C), coincident instantaneous and cumulative novelty ("novel community," N), and "back-ground communities" (B) that lacked novelty (Fig. 1B) (20). †These authors contributed equally to this work.

abstract = {In the absence of annual laminations, time series generated from lake sediments or other similar stratigraphic sequences are irregularly spaced in time, which complicates formal analysis using classical statistical time series models. In lieu, statistical analyses of trends in palaeoenvironmental time series, if done at all, have typically used simpler linear regressions or (non-) parametric correlations with little regard for the violation of assumptions that almost surely occurs due to temporal dependencies in the data or that correlations do not provide estimates of the magnitude of change, just whether or not there is a linear or monotonic trend. Alternative approaches have used {\textless}sc{\textgreater}Loess{\textless}/sc{\textgreater}-estimated trends to justify data interpretations or test hypotheses as to the causal factors without considering the inherent subjectivity of the choice of parameters used to achieve the {\textless}sc{\textgreater}Loess{\textless}/sc{\textgreater} fit (e.g., span width, degree of polynomial). Generalised additive models (GAMs) are statistical models that can be used to estimate trends as smooth functions of time. Unlike {\textless}sc{\textgreater}Loess{\textless}/sc{\textgreater}, GAMs use automatic smoothness selection methods to objectively determine the complexity of the fitted trend, and as formal statistical models, GAMs, allow for potentially complex, non-linear trends, a proper accounting of model uncertainty, and the identification of periods of significant temporal change. Here, I present a consistent and modern approach to the estimation of trends in palaeoenvironmental time series using GAMs, illustrating features of the methodology with two example time series of contrasting complexity; a 150-year bulk organic matter $\delta${\textless}sup{\textgreater}15{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}N time series from Small Water, UK, and a 3,000-year alkenone record from Braya-S{\o}, Greenland. I discuss the underlying mechanics of GAMs that allow them to learn the shape of the trend from the data themselves and how simultaneous confidence intervals and the first derivatives of the trend are used to properly account for model uncertainty and identify periods of change. It is hoped that by using GAMs greater attention is paid to the statistical estimation of trends in palaeoenvironmental time series leading to more a robust and reproducible palaeoscience.},

abstract = {[Holocene climate records are imperfect proxies for processes containing complicated mixtures of periodic and random signals. I summarize time series analysis methods for such data with emphasis on the multiple-data-window technique. This method differs from conventional approaches to time series analysis in that a set of data tapers is applied to the data in the time domain before Fourier transforming. The tapers, or data windows, are discrete prolate spheroidal sequences characterized as being the most nearly band-limited functions possible among functions defined on a finite time domain. The multiple-window method is a small-sample theory and essentially an inverse method applied to the finite Fourier transform. For climate data it has the major advantage of providing a narrowband F-test for the presence and significance of periodic components and of being able to separate them from the non-deterministic part of the process. Confidence intervals for the estimated quantities are found by jack-knifing across windows. Applied to 14C records, this method confirms the presence of the `Suess wiggles' and give an estimated period of 208.2 years. Analysis of the thickness variations of bristlecone pine growth rings shows a general absence of direct periodic components but a variation in the structure of the time series with a 2360-year period.]},

However, little is known about depth-specific periodic behavior of Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis), an important species in recreational, commercial and subsistence fisheries in the eastern North Pacific Ocean. To evaluate depth-specific periodic behavior of Pacific halibut, an approach was developed in which depth data from electronic tags were used to produce four types of complementary plots, including two-dimensional time series of depth, activity level derived from differencing adjacent depth recordings, periodograms, and wavelet transform coefficients. From a visual examination of the plots, daily depth-specific periodic behavior types, including diel, tidal, spawning, semi-lunar and lunar, were assigned to 37 individual Pacific halibut. Overall, the approach used in this study was useful for describing relatively short term depth-specific periodic behavior, but was less informative for understanding relatively long term behavioral patterns. The results suggest that patterns in occupied depth may be related to seasonal activities of Pacific halibut. Specifically, during the summer feeding season, fish most commonly behaved periodically on a diel scale or inactively laid on the seafloor, which was manifested as tidal periodicity as the height of the water column fluctuated above the fish. Both active swimming and inactivity on the seafloor may be related to different foraging strategies. During fall and spring migratory periods and the winter spawning season, no periodicity in depth-specific behavior was most common, which may correspond to directed movement over irregular bathymetry between feeding and spawning locations or to reproductive behaviors. Evidence of an additional reproductive behavior, spawning rises off the seafloor, was also observed during the winter spawning season. This approach for understanding the periodicity of occupied depth of Pacific halibut provides additional insight into the behavior of this iconic species. This knowledge perhaps may be used in the future to inform this species' management, such as refining estimates of susceptibility to capture and examining timing of movement among regulatory areas.},

abstract = {Movement pattern variations are reflective of behavioural switches, likely associated with different life history traits in response to the animals' abiotic and biotic environment. Detecting these can provide rich information on the underlying processes driving animal movement patterns. However, extracting these signals from movement time series, requires tools that objectively extract, describe and quantify these behaviours. The inference of behavioural modes from movement patterns has been mainly addressed through hidden Markov models. Until now, the metrics implemented in these models did not allow to characterize cyclic patterns directly from the raw time series. To address these challenges, we developed an approach to i) extract new metrics of cyclic behaviours and activity levels from a time-frequency analysis of movement time series, ii) implement the spectral signatures of these cyclic patterns and activity levels into a HMM framework to identify and classify latent behavioural states.},

abstract = {Mature female southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) come ashore only in October to breed and in January to moult, spending the rest of the year foraging at sea. Mature females may lose as much as 50{\%} of their body mass, mostly in lipid stores, during the breeding season due to fasting and lactation. When departing to sea, post-breeding females are negatively buoyant, and the relative change in body condition (i.e. density) during the foraging trip has previously been assessed by monitoring the descent rate during drift dives. However, relatively few drift dives are performed, resulting in low resolution of the temporal reconstruction of body condition change. In this study, six post-breeding females were equipped with time–depth recorders and accelerometers to investigate whether changes in active swimming effort and speed could be used as an alternative method of monitoring density variations throughout the foraging trip. In addition, we assessed the consequences of density change on the swimming efforts of individuals while diving and investigated the effects on dive duration. Both descent swimming speed and ascent swimming effort were found to be strongly correlated to descent rate during drift dives, enabling the fine-scale monitoring of seal density change over the whole trip. Negatively buoyant seals minimized swimming effort during descents, gliding down at slower speeds, and reduced their ascent swimming effort to maintain a nearly constant swimming speed as their buoyancy increased. One per cent of seal density variation over time was found to induce a 20{\%} variation in swimming effort during dives with direct consequences on dive duration.},

abstract = {Researchers have long attempted to follow animals as they move through their environment. Until relatively recently, however, such efforts were limited to short distances and times in species large enough to carry large batteries and transmitters. New technologies have opened up new frontiers in animal tracking remote data collection. Hussey et al. review the unique directions such efforts have taken for marine systems, while Kays et al. review recent advances for terrestrial species. We have entered a new era of animal ecology, where animals act as both subjects and samplers of their environments.Science, this issue 10.1126/science.1255642, 10.1126/science.aaa2478BACKGROUNDGlobal aquatic environments are changing profoundly as a result of human actions; consequently, so too are the ways in which organisms are distributing themselves through space and time. Our ability to predict organism and community responses to these alterations will be dependent on knowledge of animal movements, interactions, and how the physiological and environmental processes underlying them shape species distributions. These patterns and processes ultimately structure aquatic ecosystems and provide the wealth of ecosystem services upon which humans depend. Until recently, the vast size, opacity, and dynamic nature of the aquatic realm have impeded our efforts to understand these ecosystems. With rapid technological advancement over the past several decades, a suite of electronic tracking devices (e.g., acoustic and satellite transmitters) that can remotely monitor animals in these challenging environments are now available. Aquatic telemetry technology is rapidly accelerating our ability to observe animal behavior and distribution and, as a consequence, is fundamentally altering our understanding of the structure and function of global aquatic ecosystems. These advances provide the toolbox to define how future global aquatic management practices must evolve.ADVANCESAquatic telemetry has emerged through technological advances in miniaturization, battery engineering, and software and hardware development, allowing the monitoring of organisms whose habitats range from the poles to the tropics and the photic zone to the abyssal depths. This is enabling the characterization of the horizontal and vertical movements of individuals, populations, and entire communities over scales of meters to tens of thousands of kilometers and over time frames of hours to years and even over the entire lifetimes of individuals. Electronic tags can now be equipped with sensors that measure ambient physical parameters (depth, temperature, conductivity, fluorescence), providing simultaneous monitoring of animals{\{}$\backslash$textquoteright{\}} environments. By linking telemetry with biologgers (e.g., jaw-motion sensors), it is possible to monitor individual feeding events. In addition, other devices on instrumented animals can communicate with one another, providing insights into predator-prey interactions and social behavior. Coupling telemetry with minute nonlethal biopsy allows understanding of how trophic dynamics, population connectivity, and gene-level basis for organismal health and condition relate to movement. These advances are revolutionizing the scope and scales of questions that can be addressed on the causes and consequences of animal distribution and movement.OUTLOOKAquatic animal telemetry has advanced rapidly, yet new challenges present themselves in coordination of monitoring across large-spatial scales (ocean basins), data sharing, and data assimilation. The continued advancement of aquatic telemetry lies in establishing and maintaining accessible and cost-effective infrastructure and in promoting multidisciplinary tagging approaches to maximize cost benefits. A united global network and centralized database will provide the mechanism for global telemetry data and will promote a transparent environment for data sharing that will, in turn, increase global communication, scope for collaboration, intellectual advancement, and funding opportunities. An overarching global network will realize the potential of telemetry, which is essential for advancing scientific knowledge and effectively managing globally shared aquatic resources and their ecosystems in the face of mounting human pressures and environmental change.Aquatic telemetry in action.A southern rock lobster (Jasus edwardsii) (A) and a lemon shark (Negaprion brevirostris) (D) fitted with acoustic tags are detected and logged by moored receivers (D) or mobile receivers attached to opportunistic platforms or carried by large animals (C). A juvenile green turtle (Chelonia mydas) (B) fitted with a satellite tag is monitored in real time via orbiting satellites. A grey seal (Halichoerus grypus) {\{}$\backslash$textquotedblleft{\}}bioprobe{\{}$\backslash$textquotedblright{\}} (C), fitted with intercommunicating acoustic and satellite transmitters, transmits and receives data on animal interactions and ocean conditions.The distribution and interactions of aquatic organisms across space and time structure our marine, freshwater, and estuarine ecosystems. Over the past decade, technological advances in telemetry have transformed our ability to observe aquatic animal behavior and movement. These advances are now providing unprecedented ecological insights by connecting animal movements with measures of their physiology and environment. These developments are revolutionizing the scope and scale of questions that can be asked about the causes and consequences of movement and are redefining how we view and manage individuals, populations, and entire ecosystems. The next advance in aquatic telemetry will be the development of a global collaborative effort to facilitate infrastructure and data sharing and management over scales not previously possible.},
